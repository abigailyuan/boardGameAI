	In part A, we used four classes to implement the stucture of the game, a 'BoardGame', a 'Board', a 'Player' and a 'Piece'.

	'BoardGame' is the controller. It creates a board and two players.
	'Board' contains a board map which contains the input from standard input, and it adds pieces to each of the players piece list.
	'Player' calculates its own legal moves and can access the board map from 'Board' class.

	If the size of the board is n, then the complexity of reading the board map is O(n^2) and the complexity of computing legal moves is O(n).
